# Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder for CIFAR-10

This repository contains an implementation of a **Convolutional Autoencoder** designed to remove noise from CIFAR-10 images. The model is trained using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**.

## Features

- **Uses CIFAR-10 dataset** for training and evaluation.
- **Adds Gaussian noise** to images to create a noisy dataset.
- **Trains a convolutional autoencoder** to reconstruct clean images.
- **Includes visualization** of input, noisy, and denoised images.
